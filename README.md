This repository contains a demonstration of a common error in MongoDB aggregation pipelines. The bug is caused by an incorrect handling of null values or edge cases in the $group and $sort stages. The solution demonstrates how to handle these cases appropriately to produce the correct results.  The primary issue is that the pipeline is not robust enough to deal with null values, resulting in unexpected aggregation results.
